# This folder is for vault.  This stores passwords and encryption sensitve files

# Documentation on using vault passwords with playbooks
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html#vault
# For example, to use a password file user "ansible" you can create file /group_vars/vault/vault_ansible 
# In that file is one line... the password:  Ex:  cat /group_vars/vault/vault_ansible   -->  my_password

# Encrypt file for later call and use ansible-vault encrypt vault_ansible    You will have to supply vault password
# ansible@LT-A0070501:/mnt/c/GitHub/penguinpages_cluster_devops/cluster_devops/group_vars/vault$ ansible-vault encrypt vault_hypervisor
# New Vault password: 
# Confirm New Vault password: 
# Encryption successful



# How to now call each of the files for user and password as variables from within other playbooks.  But file has to have file in clear text :(
# ansible-playbook -i /group_vars/vars/inventory_iplb_servers.yml --vault-password-file=/group_vars/vault/vault_password.txt

# How to call when using vault password set from bastion node / ansible node shell. So vault password is "outside git repo as clear txt"

# Ansible then can use vault password Ex:

########### Single global Vault file format notes  ############
#### OLD: Not prefered as one file will have all passwords and users. And to change one means exposting all and also locking all from use by playbooks 
#### MASTER VAULT variables are in format within each file of:
user_(name of group):  <username>
password_(name of group): "<password>"

Ex: /group_vars/vault/vault_root
user_root: root
password_root: blah

# So variable within playbook for root user would be 
# {{user_root}}
# And varible for password would be 
# {{password_root}}
# 


### Some credentials such as cloud have key and secret which would be then:
user_(name of group): <username>
password_(name of group): "<password>"
access_key_(name of group): "<Access key ID>"
access_secret_(name of group): "<Secret access key>"
